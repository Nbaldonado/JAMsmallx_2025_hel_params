This "Parameters_GitHub" tabulates the large-N_c^{+q} KPS-CTT initial condition parameters used to complete the phenomenological analysis of of arXiv: 2503.21006 [hep-ph]; the parameters are defined by Eqs. 24 of that article. For convenience the parameters have been uploaded in both .csv and .xlsx formats.

      "Replica #" is simply a way of numbering the replicas and it has no scientific meaning.

"xhPDF" provides the $x$-scaled hPDFs seen in Fig. 7 of arXiv: 2503.21006 [hep-ph]. All computed for $Q^2 = 10$ GeV$^2$, the "x" column gives the value of $x$ (plotted on the horizontal axis), while the following columns gives the hPDF uncertainty boundaries. The uncertainties are computed as 68% confidence bands of all replicas using numpy.percentile. The upper boundary uses the percentage "50+68/2", the lower boundary uses the percentage "50-68/2", and the median (not plotted) uses percentage "50".

      "g_lower" gives the lower-boundary of the 68% condifence band from all replicas of $x \times \Delta g(x, Q^2 = 10~\text{GeV}^2)$

      "g_upper" gives the upper-boundary of the 68% condifence band from all replicas of $x \times \Delta g(x, Q^2 = 10~\text{GeV}^2)$

      "g_median"  gives the median from all replicas of $x \times \Delta g(x, Q^2 = 10~\text{GeV}^2)$

      "up_*" gives the values as defined above for $x \times \Delta u^+(x, Q^2 = 10~\text{GeV}^2)$

      "dp_*" gives the values as defined above for $x \times \Delta d^+(x, Q^2 = 10~\text{GeV}^2)$

      "sp_*" gives the values as defined above for $x \times \Delta s^+(x, Q^2 = 10~\text{GeV}^2)$

      "um_*" gives the values as defined above for $x \times \Delta u^-(x, Q^2 = 10~\text{GeV}^2)$

      "dm_*" gives the values as defined above for $x \times \Delta d^-(x, Q^2 = 10~\text{GeV}^2)$

      "sm_*" gives the values as defined above for $x \times \Delta s^-(x, Q^2 = 10~\text{GeV}^2)$
